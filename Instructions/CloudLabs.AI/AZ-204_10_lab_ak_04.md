### Exercise 3: Publish Event Grid events from .NET

#### Task 1: Create a .NET project

1.  On the **Start** screen, select the **Visual Studio Code** tile.

1.  From the **File** menu, select **Open Folder**.

1.  In the **File Explorer** window that opens, browse to **Allfiles (F):\\Allfiles\\Labs\\10\\Starter\\EventPublisher**, and then select **Select Folder**.

1.  In the **Visual Studio Code** window, right-click or activate the shortcut menu for the Explorer pane, and then select **Open in Terminal**.

1.  At the open command prompt, enter the following command, and then select Enter to create a new .NET project named **EventPublisher** in the current folder:

    ```
    dotnet new console --name EventPublisher --output .
    ```

    > **Note**: The **dotnet new** command will create a new **console** project in a folder with the same name as the project.

1.  At the command prompt, enter the following command, and then select Enter to import version 3.2.0 of **Microsoft.Azure.EventGrid** from NuGet:

    ```
    dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.EventGrid --version 3.2.0
    ```

    > **Note**: The **dotnet add package** command will add the **Microsoft.Azure.EventGrid** package from NuGet. For more information, go to [Microsoft.Azure.EventGrid](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.EventGrid/3.2.0).

1.  At the command prompt, enter the following command, and then select Enter to build the .NET web application:

    ```
    dotnet build
    ```

1.  Select **Kill Terminal** or the **Recycle Bin** icon to close the currently open terminal and any associated processes.

#### Task 2: Modify the Program class to connect to Event Grid

1.  In the Explorer pane of the **Visual Studio Code** window, open the **Program.cs** file.

1.  On the code editor tab for the **Program.cs** file, delete all the code in the existing file.

1.  Add the following line of code to import the **Microsoft.Azure.EventGrid**, and **Microsoft.Azure.EventGrid.Models** namespaces from the **Microsoft.Azure.EventGrid** package imported from NuGet:

    ```
    using Microsoft.Azure.EventGrid;
    using Microsoft.Azure.EventGrid.Models;
    ```
    
1.  Add the following lines of code to add **using** directives for the built-in namespaces that will be used in this file:

    ```
    using System;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using System.Threading.Tasks;
    ```

1.  Enter the following code to create a new **Program** class:

    ```
    public class Program
    {
    }
    ``` 

1.  In the **Program** class, enter the following line of code to create a new string constant named **topicEndpoint**:

    ```
    private const string topicEndpoint = "";
    ```

1.  Update the **topicEndpoint** string constant by setting its value to the **Topic Endpoint** of the Event Grid topic that you recorded earlier in this lab.

1.  In the **Program** class, enter the following line of code to create a new string constant named **topicKey**:

    ```
    private const string topicKey = "";
    ```

1.  Update the **topicKey** string constant by setting its value to the **Key** of the Event Grid topic that you recorded earlier in this lab.

1.  In the **Program** class, enter the following code to create a new asynchronous **Main** method:

    ```
    public static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
    }
    ```

1.  Observe the **Program.cs** file, which should now include the following lines of code:

    ```
    using Microsoft.Azure.EventGrid;
    using Microsoft.Azure.EventGrid.Models;
    using System;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using System.Threading.Tasks;

    public class Program
    {
        private const string topicEndpoint = "<topic-endpoint>";
        private const string topicKey = "<topic-key>";
        
        public static async Task Main(string[] args)
        {
        }
    }
    ```

#### Task 3: Publish new events

1.  In the **Main** method, perform the following actions to publish a list of events to your topic endpoint:

    1.  Add the following line of code to create a new variable named **credentials** of type **[TopicCredentials]()**, using the **topicKey** string constant as a constructor parameter:

        ```
        TopicCredentials credentials = new TopicCredentials(topicKey);
        ```

    1.  Add the following line of code to create a new variable named **client** of type **[EventGridClient]()**, using the **credentials** variable as a constructor parameter:

        ```
        EventGridClient client = new EventGridClient(credentials);
        ```

    1.  Add the following line of code to create a new variable named **events** of type **List<EventGridEvent>**.

        ```
        List<EventGridEvent> events = new List<EventGridEvent>();
        ```

    1.  Add the following lines of code to create a new variable named **firstPerson** of an anonymous type:

        ```
        var firstPerson = new
        {
            FullName = "Alba Sutton",
            Address = "4567 Pine Avenue, Edison, WA 97202"
        };
        ```

    1.  Add the following block of code to create a new variable named **firstEvent** of type **EventGridEvent**, and then populate the **EventGridEvent** variable with sample data:

        ```
        EventGridEvent firstEvent = new EventGridEvent
        {
            Id = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),
            EventType = "Employees.Registration.New",
            EventTime = DateTime.Now,
            Subject = $"New Employee: {firstPerson.FullName}",
            Data = firstPerson,
            DataVersion = "1.0.0"
        };
        ```

    1.  Add the following line of code to add the **firstEvent** instance to your **events** list:

        ```
        events.Add(firstEvent);
        ```

    1.  Add the following line of code to create a new variable named **secondPerson** of an anonymous type:

        ```
        var secondPerson = new
        {
            FullName = "Alexandre Doyon",
            Address = "456 College Street, Bow, WA 98107"
        };
        ```

    1.  Add the following block of code to create a new variable named **secondEvent** of type **EventGridEvent**, and then populate the **EventGridEvent** variable with sample data:

        ```
        EventGridEvent secondEvent = new EventGridEvent
        {
            Id = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),
            EventType = "Employees.Registration.New",
            EventTime = DateTime.Now,
            Subject = $"New Employee: {secondPerson.FullName}",
            Data = secondPerson,
            DataVersion = "1.0.0"
        };
        ```

    1.  Add the following line of code to add the **secondEvent** instance to your **events** list:

        ```
        events.Add(secondEvent);
        ```

    1.  Add the following line of code to obtain the **Hostname** from the **topicEndpoint** variable:

        ```
        string topicHostname = new Uri(topicEndpoint).Host;
        ```

    1.  Add the following line of code to invoke the **[EventGridClient.PublishEventsAsync](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.eventgrid.eventgridclient.publisheventswithhttpmessagesasync)** method using the **topicHostname** and **events** variables as parameters:

        ```
        await client.PublishEventsAsync(topicHostname, events);
        ```

    1.  Add the following line of code to render the **Events published** message to the console:

        ```
        Console.WriteLine("Events published");
        ```

1.  Review the **Main** method, which should now include:

    ```
    public static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        TopicCredentials credentials = new TopicCredentials(topicKey);
        EventGridClient client = new EventGridClient(credentials);

        List<EventGridEvent> events = new List<EventGridEvent>();

        var firstPerson = new
        {
            FullName = "Alba Sutton",
            Address = "4567 Pine Avenue, Edison, WA 97202"
        };

        EventGridEvent firstEvent = new EventGridEvent
        {
            Id = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),
            EventType = "Employees.Registration.New",
            EventTime = DateTime.Now,
            Subject = $"New Employee: {firstPerson.FullName}",
            Data = firstPerson,
            DataVersion = "1.0.0"
        };
        events.Add(firstEvent);

        var secondPerson = new
        {
            FullName = "Alexandre Doyon",
            Address = "456 College Street, Bow, WA 98107"
        };
        
        EventGridEvent secondEvent = new EventGridEvent
        {
            Id = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),
            EventType = "Employees.Registration.New",
            EventTime = DateTime.Now,
            Subject = $"New Employee: {secondPerson.FullName}",
            Data = secondPerson,
            DataVersion = "1.0.0"
        };
        events.Add(secondEvent);

        string topicHostname = new Uri(topicEndpoint).Host;
        await client.PublishEventsAsync(topicHostname, events);

        Console.WriteLine("Events published");
    }
    ```

1.  Save the **Program.cs** file.

1.  In the **Visual Studio Code** window, right-click or activate the shortcut menu for the Explorer pane, and then select **Open in Terminal**.

1.  At the open command prompt, enter the following command, and then select Enter to run the .NET web application:

    ```
    dotnet run
    ```

    > **Note**: If there are any build errors, review the **Program.cs** file in the **Allfiles (F):\\Allfiles\\Labs\\10\\Solution\\EventPublisher** folder.

1.  Observe the success message output from the currently running console application.

1.  Select **Kill Terminal** or the **Recycle Bin** icon to close the currently open terminal and any associated processes.

#### Task 4: Observe published events

1.  Return to the browser window with the **Azure Event Grid viewer** web application.

1.  Review the **Employees.Registration.New** events that were created by your console application.

1.  Select any of the events and review its JSON content.

1.  Return to the Azure portal.

#### Review

In this exercise, you published new events to your Event Grid topic using a .NET console application.
