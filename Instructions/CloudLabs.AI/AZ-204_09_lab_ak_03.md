    1.  In the **Actions** result list, select **List files**.
    
    1.  In the **Connection Name** field, enter **filesConnection**.
    
    1.  In the **Storage Account** section, select the **prodstor*[yourname]*** storage account that you created earlier in this lab, and then select **Create**.
    
    1.  Wait for the connector resource to finish creating.

        > **Note**: These resources take one to five minutes to create.

1.  In the **List files** area, in the **Folder** text box, enter **/metadata**.
    
#### Task 3: Create an action to project list item properties

1.  In the **Designer** area, select **+ New step**.

1.  In the **Designer** area, perform the following actions to add an **Select (Data Operations)** action:
    
    1.  In the **Search connectors and triggers** field, enter **select**.
    
    1.  In the category list, select **Data Operations**.
    
    1.  In the **Actions** result list, select **Select**.

1.  In the **Select** area, perform the following actions to configure the **Select (Data Operations)** action:
    
    1.  In the **From** field, in the **Dynamic content** list, within the **List files** category, select **value**. 
    
    1.  In the **Map** field, select **Switch to text mode**.

    1.  In the **Map** field, in the **Dynamic content** list, within the **List files** category, select **Name**.
    
#### Task 4: Build an HTTP response action

1.  In the **Designer** area, select **+ New step**, and then perform the following actions to add a **Response (Request)** action:
 
    1.  In the **Search connectors and triggers** field, enter **response**.
       
    1.  In the **Actions** result list, select **Response**.

1.  In the **Response** area, perform the following actions to configure the **Response (Request)** action:

1.  In the **Designer** area, select **Save**.

#### Review

In this exercise, you built a basic workflow that starts when it's triggered by an HTTP GET request. It then queries a storage service, enumerates the results, and then returns those results as an HTTP response.
