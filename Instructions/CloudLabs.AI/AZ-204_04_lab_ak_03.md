    1.  Ensure that **Overwrite if files already exist** is selected, and then select **Upload**.

    > **Note**: Wait for the blob to upload before you continue with this lab.

#### Task 3: Import an SQL database

1.  In the Azure portal's navigation pane, select the **Resource groups** link.

1.  From the **Resource groups** blade, find and select the **PolyglotData** resource group that you created earlier in this lab.

1.  From the **PolyglotData** blade, select the **polysqlsrvr*[yourname]*** SQL server that you created earlier in this lab.

1.  From the **SQL server** blade, select **Import database**.

1.  From the **Import database** blade, perform the following actions:

    1.  Leave the **Subscription** list set to its default value.

    1.  Select the **Storage** option.

    1.  From the **Storage accounts** blade, select the **polystor*[yourname]*** storage account that you created earlier in this lab. 

    1.  From the **Containers** blade, select the **databases** container that you created earlier in this lab. 

    1.  From the **Container** blade, select the **AdventureWorks.bacpac** blob that you created earlier in this lab, and then select **Select** to close the blade.

    1.  Back from the **Import database** blade, leave the **Pricing tier** option set to its default value.

    1.  In the **Database name** text box, enter **AdventureWorks**.

    1.  Leave the **Collation** text box set to its default value.

    1.  Select **OK**.

    > **Note**: Wait for the database to be created before you continue with this lab. If you receive a firewall-related error on the import step, it means you did not correctly configure the **Allow Azure services to access server** setting on your SQL Server earlier in the lab.  Review your settings, delete the empty **AdventureWorks** database, and then attempt your import again.
    
#### Task 4: Use an imported SQL database

1.  In the Azure portal's navigation pane, select the **Resource groups** link.

1.  From the **Resource groups** blade, find and select the **PolyglotData** resource group that you created earlier in this lab.

1.  In the Firewalls and virtual networks pane, perform the following actions:

    1.  Select **Add client IP**
    
    1.  Select **Save**.

    1.  In the **Success!** confirmation dialog, select **OK**.

    > **Note**: This step will ensure that your local machine will have access to the databases that are associated with this server.

1.  In the Azure portal's navigation pane, select the **Resource groups** link.

1.  From the **Resource groups** blade, find and select the **PolyglotData** resource group that you created earlier in this lab.

1.  From the **PolyglotData** blade, select the **AdventureWorks** SQL database that you created earlier in this lab.

1.  From the **SQL database** blade, find the **Settings** section from the blade, and then select the **Connection strings** link.

1.  In the Connection strings pane, record the value in the **ADO.NET (SQL Authentication)** text box. You'll use this value later in this lab.

1.  Update the connection string that you recorded by performing the following actions:

    1.  Within the connection string, find the *your_username* placeholder and replace it with **testuser**.

    1.  Within the connection string, find the *your_password* placeholder and replace it with **TestPa55w.rd**.

        > **Note**: For example, if your connection string was originally ``Server=tcp:polysqlsrvrinstructor.database.windows.net,1433;Initial Catalog=AdventureWorks;User ID={your_username};Password={your_password};``, your updated connection string will be ``Server=tcp:polysqlsrvrinstructor.database.windows.net,1433;Initial Catalog=AdventureWorks;User ID=testuser;Password=TestPa55w.rd;``

1.  Find and select the **Query editor (preview)** link from the blade.

1.  In the Query editor pane, perform the following actions:

    1.  In the **Login** text box, enter **testuser**.

    1.  Select **OK**.

1.  In the open query editor, enter the following query:

    ```
    SELECT * FROM AdventureWorks.dbo.Models
    ```

1.  Select **Run** to run the query, and then observe the results.

    > **Note**: This query will return a list of models from the home page of the web application.

1.  In the query editor, replace the existing query with the following query:

    ```
    SELECT * FROM AdventureWorks.dbo.Products
    ```

1.  Select **Run** to run the query, and then observe the results.

    > **Note**: This query will return a list of products that are associated with each model.

#### Review

In this exercise, you imported all the resources that you'll use with your web application.
